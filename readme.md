# Todo List
### What is the Todo List?
Todo is a React Native app built with Expo.
The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete todos.
Todos are stamped with a creation, update, or completed date, where applicable.


### User stories
- Users can sign into the app using Facebook's social login. Upon authentication, a new user profile in Firebase's database will be created. This will allow users to save their todos to the cloud, allowing the data to be pushed and pulled from any compatible device without having to make a new service specific profile.
- Users can create new todos.
- Users can edit/update previously created todos.
- Users can delete their todos.
- Users can sign out of the app.

### List of the technologies used:
